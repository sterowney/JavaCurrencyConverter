# Java Currency Converter

This is a Java Currency Converter using TDD.

I was given the task of reading a CSV file in the following format:

COUNTRY,CODE,NAME,RATE

The program must accept 3 arguments:

* Source currency in the format y.xx
* Source country code, e.g AED
* Target country code, e.g GBP
